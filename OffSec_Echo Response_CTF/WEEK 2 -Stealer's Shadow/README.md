## 📖 Challenge Overview

A quiet shadow moves through the Cyber Realms—hard to see, but easy to notice once something goes missing: old records, bound contracts, and encrypted guild documents.This week’s case looks at Stealer’s Shadow, an advanced attack on The Etherians (Megacorp One), a growing leader in construct-binding and spellcode development. The attacker slipped into their systems, ran remote code, and stole sensitive data using several layers of obfuscation.

My investigation focused on:

- Finding out what data was stolen and what tools were used
- Tracking how the malware was downloaded and run
- Rebuilding the full attack timeline
- Reviewing the C2 servers and endpoints
- Decrypting the stolen data and measuring the impact
- Pulling key information from the recovered files
- Mapping the attacker’s infrastructure
